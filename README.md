# Patients-Information-Management-System
This is a project which I built during a hackathon named HackFit hosted by MLH(Major League Hacking). As the name suggests this project manages information of patients visiting an ophthalmologist clinic. To know more about the project, you can see my [Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/patients-information-management-system).
